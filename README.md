# ðŸ—‚ Binary-File-Handling-with-Class
Implementation of Class in Python as Data Structure for Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting of Data in Binary(.dat) files.

# Key Features ðŸ“œ
MODULES Used : Utilizes Python's Built-in pickle module for serializing and deserializing data types.

CLASS Implementation : Utilizes object-oriented programming principles for efficient data management within the binary file.

READ Records : Retrieve and Display records from the binary file.

EDIT Records : Modify existing records within the binary file.

APPEND Records : Add new records to the binary file.

DELETE Records : Remove unwanted records from the binary file.

# Implementation ðŸ“„
Structure of the Data for storing and retrieving from 'fix_info.dat' file :-
